      <h1>Audio Glossary</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Amplification:</dt></strong>
        <dd>The process of increasing the power of an audio signal to drive headphones or speakers effectively.</dd>

        <dt><strong>DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):</dt></strong>
        <dd>A device that converts digital audio signals (like an MP3 or FLAC file) into an analog signal that headphones or speakers can play.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Driver:</dt></strong>
        <dd>The component inside a headphone or speaker that vibrates to produce sound waves. Different types include dynamic, planar magnetic, and balanced armature.</dd>

        <dt><strong>FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec):</dt></strong>
        <dd>An audio file format that compresses digital audio without any loss in quality. It provides bit-perfect copies of the original source, unlike lossy formats (like MP3).</dd>

        <dt><strong>Frequency Response:</dt></strong>
        <dd>The range of sound frequencies (from low bass to high treble, measured in Hertz or Hz) that a piece of audio equipment can reproduce. It's often shown on a graph to illustrate which frequencies are emphasized or reduced.</dd>

        <dt><strong>IEM (In-Ear Monitor):</dt></strong>
        <dd>Small headphones that are inserted directly into the ear canal. They offer excellent sound isolation by blocking outside noise and are popular with musicians and audiophiles.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Imaging:</dt></strong>
        <dd>The ability of headphones or speakers to create a precise and stable sense of where individual instruments and sounds are located within the stereo field (e.g., "left," "right," "center").</dd>

        <dt><strong>Impedance (Ohm / Î©):</dt></strong>
        <dd>A measure of electrical resistance, indicating how much power is required to drive the headphones. High-impedance headphones (e.g., > 100 Ohms) often require a dedicated amplifier to reach their full potential.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Lossless / Lossy:</dt></strong>
        <dd>
            <strong>Lossless:</strong> An audio compression format (like FLAC or ALAC) that retains all of the original audio data, allowing for perfect reconstruction of the source.
            <br>
            <strong>Lossy:</strong> An audio compression format (like MP3 or AAC) that permanently discards some audio data (especially sounds considered inaudible) to achieve smaller file sizes.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Sensitivity (dB):</dt></strong>
        <dd>A measure of how loud headphones will play at a given power level (usually measured in decibels (dB) per milliwatt). Higher sensitivity means the headphones are "easier to drive" and will get louder with less power.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Soundstage:</dt></strong>
        <dd>The perceived three-dimensional space and spaciousness of the audio. A "wide" soundstage makes it feel like the sound is coming from outside your head, while a "narrow" one feels more intimate and in-your-head.</dd>
    </dl>
