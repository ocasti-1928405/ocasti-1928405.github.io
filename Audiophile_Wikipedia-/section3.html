       <h1>What is a Transducer?</h1>
<p>A Transducer is the general term for any device that converts one form of energy into another. In our case, electrical energy into sound waves.</p>

<h2>Headphones:</h2>
<p>Headphones use small transducers called drivers to convert the amplified electrical signal into sound waves that we can hear. There are several types of headphone drivers, each with its own characteristics:</p>

<h2>Form Factors:</h2>

<h3>Over-Ear:</h3>
<p>These are your usual headphones, where the pads encircle the ear.</p>

<h3>On-Ear:</h3>
<p>On ear-headphones are similar to headphones in terms of build, though the difference remains in the structure of the pads, where they rest on the ear itself.</p>

<h3>In-ear Monitors (IEMs):</h3>
<p>IEMs, inserted directly into the ear canal, typically spoken of within the Hi-Fi community are referring to wired earphones.</p>

<h2>Closed-back vs. Open-back Headphones</h2>

<h3>Closed-Back Headphones</h3>
<p>Closed-back headphones are designed with ear-cups that make a seal around the ears. This design gives great noise isolation, blocking out the external world, 
    along with the added bonus of preventing your music from “leaking out”. This seal creates a more pronounced bass response, making them ideal for <ins>public use.</ins></p>

<h3>Open-Back Headphones</h3>
<p>Open-back headphones have openings that allow air and sound to pass through. 
    This creates a natural, spacious listening experience. However, they don’t isolate sound, because of which, 
    it is generally recommended for quiet, <ins>private listening environments</ins> to fully appreciate the detailed experience.</p>
