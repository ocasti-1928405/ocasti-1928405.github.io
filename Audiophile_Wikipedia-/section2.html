                     <h1>What is an Amplifier?</h1>
                 <img src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2024/01/heaphoneamps-2048px-ifi.jpg?auto=webp&quality=75&width=1024" alt="An iFi brand DAC/Amp combo unit" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
        <p>
            The analog signal that comes out of a DAC is very weak. 
            An <em>amplifier</em> takes that clean signal and boosts its power. 
            This is crucial because different headphones require different amounts of power to sound their best. 
            Headphones with high impedance or low sensitivity are "harder to drive" and require a more powerful amplifier to reach an appropriate volume and to properly control the driver for tight bass and clear sound. 
            Amplifiers come in various forms, including dedicated headphone amps, large speaker amps, and integrated units that combine multiple functions.
        </p>
            
             <h2>Why Do I Need One?</h2>
        <p>Using a dedicated amplifier can significantly improve your listening experience, especially if you're using high-end headphones or speakers. A good amplifier ensures that the audio signal is strong enough to drive your headphones properly, resulting in better dynamics, clarity, and overall sound quality. It can also reduce distortion and noise, allowing you to hear more detail in your music.</p>
              
              <h3>Impedance (Î©):</h3>
                      <p><em>Refers to the amount of electrical current a speaker/headphone draws, the higher the ohm rating, the more it "resists" the incoming signal or sound.</em></p>

              <h3>Sensitivity (dB):</h3>
                      <p><em>A number that tells you how loud the headphone/speaker is going to play given the certain amount of voltage passing through.</em></p>

              <p>
                 Depending on your headphones' impedance and sensitivity, a dedicated amplifier might be necessary to achieve optimal sound quality. 
                 Therefore it is important to match your amplifier's power output to your headphones' requirements for the best listening experience.
